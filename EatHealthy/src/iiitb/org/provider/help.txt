Eat Healthy is a Java based applet which gives you nutritional values of various
food items when provided with its image. It can accept the URL of image in the
provided text field or can process on an image in local storage. Either way, it
uses advanced image recognition and artificial intelligence techniques to
determine the tags associated with the dish. The tags thus retrieved are then
compared with the tags stored in a concise database created by the developers.
Alternatively, the tags can be compared to some website. Using the database,
various nutritional facts about the food item are displayed on the screen.
