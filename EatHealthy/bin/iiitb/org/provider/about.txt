ABOUT "EAT HEALTHY!"

"Eat Healthy!" was developed by Akshay Pant(IMT2015005), Kashish Jain(IMT2015020)
and Vaibhav Aggarwal(IMT2015045), students of International Institute of
Information Technology, Bangalore(IIIT-B) as a part of their Java project in
the third semester.
The idea is to keep a check on the calories consumed by an individual and as the
name suggests - EAT HEALTHY!
